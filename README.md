# ðŸ¤– Auto Areas

> A custom component for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io) which automates your areas.

Assigning entities and devices to areas allows to create certain kind of automations **automatically**.

An **area** could be a room or any other part of your home.

Example setup of areas and entities:

```
- Living room
	- Motion sensor
	- Another motion sensor
	- Multiple lights
- Bedroom
	- Motion sensor
	- Light
- Bathroom
	- Motion sensor
	- Light
- Garden
	- Multiple lights
```

If an area has one or multiple motion sensors assigned they can be used to determine whether a room is currently occupied. 

In most of the cases lights in a room should be turned on if presence is detected. Once occupancy is cleared the lights should turn off again.

To achieve this, without this component, it would be necessary to set up [automations](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/automation/) for all sensors and lights for each of your areas (and maintain them).

**Auto Areas** tries to make your life easier: it checks each of your areas for relevant devices and starts managing them automatically ðŸš€.

The only prerequisite is to define areas and assign relevant entities and devices to them in HomeAssistant.
For information on how to use this component in your setup refer to [Installation](#installation).

## Features

### Aggregated presence detection

Tracks the state of multiple sensor entities (for example motion sensors) to detect area presence.
It aggregates presence based on these rules:

- An area is considered "occupied" if there is at least one sensor in state `on` (for example "motion detected").
- Only if all sensors are `off` the area presence is cleared is considered empty.

Currently the following entities are supported:

- `binary_sensor` (with device class: `motion`, `occupancy`, `presence`)

The presence state is published to a `binary_sensor` which will be named according to the area: `binary_sensor.auto_presence_{area_name}`.

### Control lights automatically

Turns lights on and off based on area presence.

[Scenarios (Gherkin)](tests/features/lights.feature)

### Sleep mode

For areas marked as "sleeping area" automatic light control can be temporarily turned off. Lights are never turned on even if presence is detected.

A switch with ID `switch.auto_sleep_mode_{area_name}` is created for each sleeping area.
If the switch is turned `on`, automatic light control will be disabled and lights will stay off.

For information on how to configure this feature refer to the [configuration section](#configuration).

### Presence lock

If only relying on motion sensors, presence could be cleared if there is only little or no movement. Presence lock can be used to treat an area as "occupied" regardless of sensor state.

A new switch with ID `switch.auto_presence_lock_{area_name}` is created for each area. If the switch is `on`, lights will not be turned off.

This is enabled for all areas.

### Aggregate sensor data

Measurement values for `temperature`, `humidity`, `illuminance` from multiple devices are aggregated per area.

## Installation

Install as custom_component for HomeAssistant.

1. Place in `custom_components` folder of your Home Assistant installation. Or add as [custom repository](https://hacs.xyz/docs/faq/custom_repositories) in HACS.
2. Add an entry in `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
auto_areas:
```

Entities are auto-discovered based on the area they're assigned to in Home Assistant.

## Configuration

The behaviour of areas can be customised by adding additional configuration in YAML.

Using the (normalised) name of the area as key additional options can be enabled. In the following example the area with name `bedroom` is marked as sleeping area:

```yaml
# configuration.yaml

auto_areas:
  bedroom:
    is_sleeping_area: true
```

| Area option        | Description                                                                                         | Default value      |
| ------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `is_sleeping_area` | Mark area as sleeping area. A switch for controlling sleep mode is created. [See more](#sleep-mode) | `false` (disabled) |

## Development

Install dependencies:
`pip install --disable-pip-version-check -r requirements_test.txt`

Run tests:
`pytest`

Using [DevContainer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) is recommended (see config in `.devcontainer`).
